Engage with Customers A blog is a great way to engage with current and potential customers as they follow your updates. With blog posts, you can get information out there without applying any pressure on your customers or coming across as too ‘salesmeny’.

The informal communication and collaborative nature that can take place on a blog invites customer feedback. When followers comment and engage with you and your company, they are much more likely to try your product, your service, or follow your company.

<h2>Engage<b> with Customers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blog is a great way to engage with current and potential customers as they follow your updates. With blog posts, you can get information out there without applying any pressure on your customers or coming across as too ‘salesmeny’. Take this opportunity to be more personable, connect with your audience. In a blog post, you can share things that may not be as applicable in more traditional forms of advertising. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The informal communication and collaborative nature that can take place on a blog invites customer feedback. When followers comment and engage with you and your company, they are much more likely to try your product, your service, or follow your company. </span></p>
<h2><b>Low Cost</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best reasons to start a blog—it can be free or very low cost. With a high quality and well-kept blog, the return is extremely high for what you are investing. This is a very cost-effective way to interact with and market to potential customers. Some blogs are completely free, if you’d like a professional to work on your blog it is still a low cost generally for such a high return. Blogs are easy to set up and maintain. </span></p>
<h2><b>Set a Tone and Brand </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have set up your blog, set some guidelines to follow. Being consistent in your posting, voice, and content will benefit you greatly. Set a simple set of rules for yourself that include how often you should post, what to include in your posts (pictures, subheadings, links, etc.), and what kind of tone you want to set for your blog. Looking at other blogs for inspiration may help you to choose a style that you like. Research what works and what fits your branding. When looking through other blogs, compare posts and see what they have in common. Each post on your blog should be clearly branded for your company. </span></p>
<h2><b>Relevant Content</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep an audience, keep your blog relevant. If you want to draw in a certain demographic, cater to that demographic. Posting content that is relevant to your audience and company will keep your followers following. When you post content that does not relate to your company—it doesn’t benefit you. Similarly, when you post content that doesn’t relate to your audience—it doesn’t benefit them. Don’t just post for posting&#8217;s sake, post something beneficial. </span></p>
<h2><b>Update Often</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though setting up a blog is pretty simple, often time people will set it up and then no follow through on posting regularly—this won’t help you much. Updating your blog regularly will not only keep your company relevant, but it is also very helpful for SEO purposes. A blog can help drive traffic to your site. New and relatable content that uses specific keywords to target your desired demographic will bring the right people to your site. </span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Email marketing can be a very effective form of marketing when done right. Are you sending out emails regularly but not seeing results? Try a few of these tips to make the most of your efforts and reap the rewards. 1. A catchy email subject line. The subject line can make or break your email. It will be the first thing your customer sees. Use short, quick, and catchy phrases that will draw in a reader and lead them to want to learn more! 2. Offer an opt-in option. Your click-through rate will increase if you’re email people who actually want to read your emails. If you’ve found that your rate is exceptionally low, offer a double opt-in option when people sign up, giving them a chance to be sure that they really want to be hearing from you. 3. Utilize the preview text. Boost your chances of getting your email open by using that preview text. Give a little sample of what content found in the email without giving up an vital information. Make sure that they need to click to get answers but give them a reason to click! 4. Format your email better. The formatting of your email will greatly impact how much and which portions of the email get read.

Are you sending out emails regularly but not seeing results? Try a few of these tips to make the most of your efforts and reap the rewards.</p>
<p><strong>1. A catchy email subject line.</strong><br />
The subject line can make or break your email. It will be the first thing your customer sees. Use short, quick, and catchy phrases that will draw in a reader and lead them to want to learn more!</p>
<p><strong>2. Offer an opt-in option.</strong><br />

<p><strong>5. Content, content, content!</strong><br />
Nothing will beat high-quality content. Make sure that you are sending out information that people will really care about. Spamming inboxes with every little happening going on in your business will not profit you. Spend out well-curated content that will leave the readers wanting to hear more from you.</p>
<p><strong>6. Time it just right.</strong><br />
Many email subscription services will allow you to schedule your emails to be sent at a prime time. There are certain times of day when people are more likely to read emails than others. Figure out which times and days are best for your audience and utilize that information when sending emails.</p>
<p><strong>7. Don’t spam.</strong><br />
No one likes a spammed inbox. One of the most common reasons for unsubscribing or for just mindlessly deleting emails is spam. Avoid sending out too much and too often to remain relevant and avoid having your email end up in the spam folder or trash.</p>
<p><strong>8. Clean out your email list.</strong><br />
Some of the email addresses on your subscriber list may no longer be active emails or they may not be reading your emails. Go through your list, clean out addresses that are no longer profitable.</p>
<p><strong>9. A/B Test everything.</strong><br />
If something isn’t working, test it out. Why isn’t it working? The first step to solving the problem is identifying it. When sending out an email, try sending the same email with two different subject lines. Or the same email with two different formats. Identifying the best way for you and your business to communicate will lead to more effective email marketing.</p>
<p><strong>10. Clear call to action.</strong><br />
Including a simple and clearly stated call to action in your subject line, preview text, and email will lead to action. Giving too many steps will likely deter people. Make it as easy as possible for them to act.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you creating a new website? When you’re weighing your options, know what you want to get out of your site before you go with a custom website or a template website builder. Website Builders (Template) Going with a website builder has its benefits. It’s generally a cheaper option, fairly easy to use for those who aren’t familiar with coding languages and fast to create. A website builder is a tool that has a design template and coding in place, allowing you to bypass the process of building and designing a website with a pre-made set functional design. Though it is cheaper and faster, there are also reason to not choose a website builder. Because it is a pre-set template, it is generally a more generic design. To a trained eye, it is easy to spot a template site. Website templates offer poor SEO, which leads to fewer views and potential sales. If you want your website to serve the purpose of making money, it would be a good idea to invest in it—both time and money. However, if your site is a small business, non-profit, personal blog, or something else that may not have the funds to invest, a template can be a good place to start. Custom Websites Custom websites made by a professional designer can take your vision and turn it into a reality. You can have a unique design for your site that will set you apart from competitors. If you are hoping to make money off of your websites, you will need to invest money into your site. Consider the opportunity cost of a custom and professional looking website.

		<description><![CDATA[Lost in the world of paid advertising? It can be a lot to compute. Today, we’re sharing with you a few key methods to paid advertising to help you maneuver your way through the digital marketing world. Pay Per Click (PPC) PPC ads are paid for only when they are clicked on. One of the benefits of this form of advertising is that you do not pay if nobody clicks on your ads. The price will vary based on the marketplace value of the keywords or expression you are targeting—calculated by the ads quality score and the competition for that market. Because you are competing with other advertainments for these clicks, the price can be higher, and you risk overspending. Social Media Advertising Advertising on social media can be very beneficial—when done correctly. Most platforms offer an option for paid advertising, the biggest including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and Snapchat. Some platforms will yield quicker results than others. Research each platform and their benefits to utilizing the one that best fits your needs. Facebook, for example, offers detailed targeting options and stretches across many different demographics. Whereas, Instagram play to more of the millennial demographic. Instagram is owned by Facebook, so it is possible to utilize an ad across both platforms. Cost Per Impression (CPM) CPM ads are billed at a flat rate per impressions. This means that it’s measured by the number of times an ad is displayed or left an “impression” on a user. Clicks and interactions are not factored into the payment. This is generally a better option for visual ads that can make more of an impression. CPMs are usually more inexpensive, and because of the flat rate, there isn’t a risk of overspending.

The short answer is—not exactly. A small website run by a local company on a template platform with very few or no competitors and an average amount of content will be impacted by SEO differently than a large international company on a custom designed site with hundreds of competitors and endless content. SEO requires ongoing work. SEO—or search engine optimization—gets traffic to your site by obtaining search engine rankings for different keyword searches. All of this traffic comes from somewhere, mainly your competitors that previously had the traffic. Just as you got the traffic, you can lose the traffic. When you stop focusing on SEO, the flow of traffic that comes from it slows and eventually stops. But this result will differ based on your competitors and the strength of yours and their SEO. There are many factors that go into your SEO. Invest in SEO. Investing time and money into SEO will pay off in the long run, it is a long-term marketing tactic. You may not see results from your SEO efforts for up to six months. The longer you invest in SEO the more it will benefit you over time. It’s hard to nail down an exact timeline of when your SEO will start benefitting you and how long it will last, but typically these things will be impacted by your current traffic, domain age, meta descriptions, geographic locations, keywords, competition, and target market.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook can be a useful tool for promoting your brand and engaging with your customers. This platform is one of (if not the) most popular social media outlet with 2.23 billion active users. You can certainly reach a wide audience on Facebook, but if you aren’t reaching them with quality content, does it really benefit you? Make the most of your digital marketing efforts by avoiding these common Facebook post mistakes.   Using Too Much Text Be clear and concise in your posting. When scrolling through a Facebook feed, followers are less likely to stop and read an entire paragraph (or multiple paragraphs). However, if you have a short, simple, and relatable caption, it will likely get more notice. Make it as easy as possible for your followers. Posting Multiple Links Posting multiple links in a single post can be confusing. Take the opportunity to split that post into two more concise posts. This way you get more content and better content. Not Responding To Negative Comments Though negative comments can be discouraging, not responding to them can be just as damaging as the comment itself. You may not be able to fix the problem and you shouldn’t aggravate the problem, but facing it head-on with an amiable response will reflect well on you. Asking For Likes and Shares It’s true that likes and shares are important. They will certainly boost your post. However, asking for likes and shares can come off as unprofessional. Instead, try asking a question in your post. This will encourage commenting, which will also boost engagement.
